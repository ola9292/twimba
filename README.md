# twimba
this App is a twitter clone where you can add tweets, view replies, like/unlike, retweet/unretweet tweets.
It doesn't have the full functionality of real twiiter yet but it was a great project for me to learn numerous things like teh for each, dataset attribute, UUID and many other things
It was built with Html,Css and JavaScript.
